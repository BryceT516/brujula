_Yet another Ruby RAML parser aiming for version 1.0 fully support_

# Status

Brujula is still under development and not the full RAML specification is covered. Please see `SPEC_SUPPORT.md` for more information.

# Use

Install the gem `brujula` via your preferred method, and use `parse_file` to load and parse any RAML file

```ruby
require 'brujula'

raml = Brujula.parse_file('path/my_example_api.raml')

# Alternatively

raml_string = <<-RAML
# version 1.0
title: 'My example API'
/examples:
  get:

RAML

raml = Brujula.parse_string(raml_string)
```

As expected, the properties of the root object can be accessed from the root object

```ruby
raml.root.title
=> 'My example API'
```

Object collections, such as Resources, Methods or Security Schemes, inherits from `Brujula::MapObject`, which implements the `Enumerable` module. Thus, you can use any of this module's method to get collection objects.

```ruby
raml.root.resources.each_with_object([]) do |resource, resource_names|
  resource_names << resource.name
end
```

Alternatively, you can you use hash methods such as `[]` or `fetch` to get specific objects by its key name

```ruby
raml.root.resources['/examples']
```


## Contributing

Pull request are kindly requested. Specially in the form of RAML examples. If you are using some advances features of RAML 1.0 spec, like annotations, type inheritance or libraries, and you would like to help this project, please have a look at `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
